# App-Excel
---
  What are we proposing ?<br>
An app that would increase efficency, reduce the repetitive manual work and time required for Ops as well as resolving the feedback that deter users to respond quickly.<br>
  Why ?<br>
Having to message every user one by one is tedious and time consuming for the Ops. Ops will have to manually check through the excel, private message each of the user, then follow up frequently and perform the repetitive work until it is done.<br>
For users, checking resource information require user to login to the cloud console and perform relevant action can be troublesome and hence delaying the response based on observation and feedback.<br>
  ○ Common feedback from users<br>
    ■ What are the ip of the machines<br>
    ■ Not aware that they are incharge of the 组件<br>
    ■ Owner had changed<br>
  How ?<br>
The app should be able to scan the excel and display the required info/details all at one page for users to reduce the number of action needed so that user can response back quickly.<br>
The app can also produce an list of users that have yet to fill in the required row / column in the excel for Ops and the Ops can trigger an alert / message to the respective user to remind them. Using AWS to create a server and build the app which should consist of a frontend interface, a simple backend and database. Using Python as the programming language, we can store the codes in Git. Jenkins can be use to perform the CI....
